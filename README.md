## Installing PHP
- Windows:
    + Go to https://windows.php.net/download/
    + Download the zip file for the latest x64 thread safe version,
      e.g. https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-8.1.4-Win32-vs16-x64.zip
    + Unzip the downloaded file, e.g. to C:\Users\Me\Downloads\php folder.
    + There may be the need to install the x64 version of the Visual C++ Redistributable for
      Visual Studio first. The link is provided on the left panel, e.g. https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.x64.exe
    + Open the command prompt by pressing Win + R and typing "cmd", or right-clicking the Start Menu
      button and typing "cmd".
    + Go to the folder where PHP is downloaded to and type "php --version"
      to see if it works.
- macOS:
    + PHP is bundled with macOS since macOS X (10.0.0) prior to macOS Monterey (12.0.0).
    + To install it, go to https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.macosx.packages.php and follow
      the instructions here.
    + Open the terminal by pressing Cmd + Space and typing "terminal".
    + Type "php --version" to see if it works.
- Linux / UNIX:
    + The instructions here use Ubuntu as an example.
    + Go to https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/programming-php and follow the instructions there.
